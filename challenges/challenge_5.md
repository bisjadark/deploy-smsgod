# Social Engineering Challenge 5

----------------------

I was just talking to Scotty (IT Director) today, and he told me some hacker has been poking at their system lately and he reset all the passwords just to be safe. He did say though that he had trouble getting ahold of Kylo via phone, and ended up just leaving a voicemail message with Kylo's new password on it.

Here's the thing. I happen to know Kylo is not using a pin on his voicemail system. Instead, to access it he just calls it from his phone, and his voicemail authenticates by looking at caller ID (this is surprisingly common).

Let's see if we can hear his voicemail with the password by calling his number while spoofing his number at the same time.
