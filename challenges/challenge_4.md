# Social Engineering Challenge 4

----------------------

Scotty (IT Director) recently created a new account on our system for Kylo (IT Guy) to access the database.

You can access the login at /admin/. Kylo's username is "kylo". I bet if Kylo receives an SMS that appears to be from his boss's phone number asking him to change his password to something, he'd totally do it.

Frank Johnson (Chief Security Officer, Veritas Inc.)

NOTE - Kylo will set his password to exactly the contents of whatever SMS his bosses' phone number sends him. So don't bother with buttering him up, just send the SMS with a single word, which will change his password to it.
